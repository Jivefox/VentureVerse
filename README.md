# VentureVerse

This Ruby Gem needlessly scrapes a fan site of the adult animated televsion show The Venture Bros. and returns some very cursory information for provided episodes and the characters that inhabit them!  Information is scraped from the fansite venturebrothers.fandom.com.  

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'VentureVerse'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install VentureVerse

## Usage

After installation, simply run ./vin/VentureVerse from the command line and have what little possible fun you can have peeking around a truncated inventory of Venture Bros. trivia!

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
